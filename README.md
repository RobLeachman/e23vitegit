Escape Room '23

Every 3 years or so I get the itch to create. This time it is an escape room built with
Phaser! 

Inventory items are interactable and the content is better (will be better) than in the 
previous game which was really just a test. This is a test too and I'm pleased with
the result.

Lessons learned in 2019: I got the game to work but kinda hated on Unity before it was done. 
And forget about monetization -- hacks upon hacks that were no fun at all.

Hopefully this year's version will be ... Less Banal
